## 🚀 How to Use & Configure

### 1. Save File Sync
By default, the app automatically finds and monitors your game save at:
`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\TesseractStudio\TaskbarHero\SaveFile_Live.es3`

- If you are playing on a different setup or want to load a backup, click **Select Save File** in the settings.
- Click **Manual Reload** to force an immediate refresh of the save file.

### 2. Connect Steam (Highly Recommended)
Without a Steam login, the Steam Market blocks price requests after a short time (returning `429 Too Many Requests`). 
- Click **Connect Steam** in the top right or settings.
- A secure Steam login window will open. Log in as you normally would.
- Once logged in, the app will capture session cookies to raise your rate limit, and then close the window.
- **Your credentials are never stored or shared.** All requests are read-only and local to your machine.

### 3. High-Value Item Alerts
Get native desktop and Telegram notifications when you obtain a rare or valuable item:
- Open Settings in TBH Helper.
- Under **Min Price Threshold ($)**, set the minimum value (e.g., `5` or `10`) for items you want to get alerts for.
- Set it to `0` to disable these alerts.
- Whenever the game updates your save file with a new item exceeding this price, an alert will be triggered.

### 4. Setup Telegram Notifications (100% Free)
Get notified instantly on your phone when you get high-value drops:
1. Message `@BotFather` on Telegram and send `/newbot` to create your own bot and get a **Bot Token**.
2. Message `@GetIDBot` to get your own **Chat ID**.
3. Search for your bot on Telegram, click **Start**.
4. Open Settings in TBH Helper, check **Enable Telegram Alerts**, enter your token and chat ID, and click **Test Connection**.

### 5. Close to Tray Settings
- By default, closing the app window hides it to the **System Tray** (bottom-right taskbar area) so it can continue watching prices and notifying you.
- To open it again, **left-click the tray icon** or right-click it and choose **Show App**.
- To shut down the app completely, right-click the tray icon and select **Quit**.
- If you prefer the app to exit immediately when closing the window, go to **Settings** and uncheck **Close to Tray**.
